I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.,ham
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.",ham
This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase.,spam

"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised.",spam
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.,spam
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.,spam

This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.,spam
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users.",ham
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",ham
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast,ham
Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.,ham
Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,ham
Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.,ham
"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good.",spam
My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!,ham
Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.,spam
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price.",ham
I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since,ham
My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.,spam

Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.,spam
Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.,ham

This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.,ham
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.,spam
I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol,ham
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing.",ham
Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.,ham

Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad,ham
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal,spam
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!,ham
"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around.",spam
"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat.",ham
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members.",ham
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money.",ham
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.,spam
"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine.",ham
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.,ham
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.",spam
"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.",ham
Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.,spam
Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.,spam
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",ham
"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.",ham
Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.,ham
"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail.",ham
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.,ham
"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ).",spam
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows.",spam
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases,ham

Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.,spam
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.,spam
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size.",ham
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!",spam
Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!,ham
"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze.",ham
"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?",ham
"She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her ""bargain"" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it.",ham
"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive.",spam
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others,ham
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!,ham

I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.,spam
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for,spam
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood,ham
"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled.",ham
"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...",ham
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...,ham
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!",ham
my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality,ham
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it,spam

I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point.",spam
"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use",spam
"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it",spam
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have",ham

"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this.",ham

"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price.",spam
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.",ham
"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!",ham
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.,spam
overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice,ham
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.,ham
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price,ham
I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.,spam

Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.,ham

also great for listening to music and also for movies,ham
The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.,ham
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader,ham
"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself.",ham
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,ham
"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!",ham
"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library.",ham
Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.,ham

As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",spam

"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music.",ham
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.,spam
Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.,ham
Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected,ham

"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",spam
"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet",spam

I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,spam
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!,ham

The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!,ham
Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.,ham
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!,ham
Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!,ham

So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.,ham
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it,ham
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.,ham

"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members).",ham
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",ham
"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy.",ham
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.",spam
"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",ham
I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.,ham
"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet).",spam
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.",ham
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat.",ham
The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos,spam

Overall, I am satisfied with this device.",ham

"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money.",spam
This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.,ham

"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun.",ham
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!",ham
You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!,ham

Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.,spam
"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.",ham
So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.,spam
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.,ham
"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!",ham
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift,ham
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.,ham

"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !",ham
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!",spam
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one.",ham
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for",ham
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.",spam
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS.",ham
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.,ham
"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet.",ham
Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it,spam
"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games",ham
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect,ham
Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.,ham
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.,ham
The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it,spam
Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.,spam
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games,spam
This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.,ham
I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right,ham
"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast.",ham
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!,ham
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all,ham
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price.",ham
"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already.",ham
Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.,ham
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",ham
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages.",spam
"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults",ham
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.",ham
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.,ham
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great.",ham
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want.",spam
We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!,ham
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.,ham
I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.,ham
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!,spam
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime,ham

I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price,ham
"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too",spam
"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it.",spam
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.,ham
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!,ham
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing.",ham
Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on,spam
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket,ham
"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest.",ham
Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts,ham
Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down,spam
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet,ham
"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift.",spam
I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.,spam
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.,ham
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.,ham
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly,spam
"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials.",ham
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful,ham
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad.",ham
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.,ham
Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with,ham
Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.,ham
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading.",spam
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.,spam
"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back.",spam
"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies"".",spam
Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,ham
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,ham
The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.,ham
"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down.",ham
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.,spam
I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break,spam
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much,ham
Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet,ham
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways",spam
Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.,ham
"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well.",ham
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.,ham
Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games,ham
"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)",spam
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media,ham
"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories.",ham
For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal,ham
Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.,ham
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,",ham
It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!,spam
good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.,ham
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",ham
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop.",ham
Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.,ham
"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others.",spam
"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch.",spam
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow.",ham
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader,spam
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.",ham
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.,spam
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets.",spam
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.",ham
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it.",spam
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.,spam
"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well.",ham
"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting",ham
I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.,ham

The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.,ham

Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read,ham
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.,ham

If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.,spam
"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use.",spam
I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.,ham
Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.,ham
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.,spam
"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price.",ham
Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,spam
Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read,spam
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.,spam
"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge...",ham
"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need",ham
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,ham
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it.",ham
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.,spam
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.,ham
"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs.",spam
"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :(",ham
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.,ham
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product,ham
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.,ham
"I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet.",ham
Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.,ham
"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",ham
I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.,ham
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this",spam
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.,ham
"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc.",spam
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job,ham
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old,ham
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .,spam
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.",spam
"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better.",ham
"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet.",ham
"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!",ham
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.,ham
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",ham
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.,ham
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!,ham
"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.",spam
"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it.",spam
Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,ham
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use,spam
"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.",spam
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well,ham
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.,ham
Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.,spam

This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!,ham
"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.",ham
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.,ham
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use,ham
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users,ham
"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage",ham
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.",ham
Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.,ham
"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!",ham
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places.",spam

Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet,spam
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,ham
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!,ham
"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet.",ham

My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!",ham
"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading.",ham
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen.",ham
"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone.",ham
"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight.",ham
Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.,spam
"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!",ham
İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs,ham
"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too.",ham
"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet.",ham
"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.",spam
"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB.",ham
I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?,spam
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small.",ham
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment.",ham
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love.",ham
"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple",ham
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids,spam
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.",ham
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,ham
"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this.",spam
"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.",ham
"Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product",ham
"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation",ham
"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading",ham
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.,ham
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.,ham
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.,ham
Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.,spam
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there.",ham
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.,ham
Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.,spam
the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.,ham
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.,spam
"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!",spam
As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose,ham
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.,spam
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it,ham
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.,ham
"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",ham
"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE",ham
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.,spam
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.,ham
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.,ham
Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak,spam
We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.,spam
Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.,spam
"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!",ham
"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news.",spam
"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors.",ham
Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!,ham
This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew,ham
My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.,ham
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.,ham
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",ham
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.,spam
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!,ham
I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.,ham
"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money.",ham
I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.,ham
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.,ham
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.,ham
Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.,spam
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price.",ham
I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.,spam
This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.,ham
This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!,ham
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!,ham
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.,spam
"Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire.",spam
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price,ham
the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great,ham
"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!",spam
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.,spam
"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen",ham
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...,spam
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.,spam
This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.,ham
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it,spam
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.,ham
"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP",ham
This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.,ham
I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.,ham
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!,spam
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.,ham
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.,ham
"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended.",ham
"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in.",ham
Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.,spam
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing,ham
"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon.",spam
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend.",ham
This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.,ham
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.,ham
Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.,ham
Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.,ham
Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up,ham
We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!,ham
"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!",ham
"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!",ham
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix.",ham
"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising.",ham
My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads,spam
"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one.",ham
Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.,ham
"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",ham
Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!,ham
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.,spam
Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.,spam
"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life.",ham
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY,ham
For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.,ham
My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.,ham
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.,ham
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.,ham
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.,ham
Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day,spam
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display,ham
"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied",ham
Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.,spam
"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping.",ham
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it.",spam
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use,ham
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel",ham
"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member.",ham
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.,ham
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do,ham
"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books.",ham
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service,spam
New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.,ham
Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.,spam
Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.,ham
It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it,spam
I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.,ham
"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price",spam
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use.",ham
This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality,ham
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.,ham
"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though.",ham
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",ham
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.",ham
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.,spam
Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.,spam
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet,ham
I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!,ham
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.,ham
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.",ham
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.,ham
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",ham
"I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well.",ham
This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do,spam
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!",ham
I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.,spam
"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology.",ham
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.",ham
Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.,ham
Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use,ham
"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle.",ham
I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.,spam
My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!,spam
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.,spam
Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay,spam
This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.,ham
"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad.",ham
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet,ham
This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues,spam
Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price,spam
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great",ham
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",ham
Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.,ham
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done.",spam
"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase.",spam
Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it,ham
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.,ham
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",ham
"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection.",spam
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,spam
Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover,ham
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.,spam
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her.",ham
"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation.",ham
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.,ham

"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it.",spam
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.,ham
"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising.",ham
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine",spam
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.",ham
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).",ham
"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!",ham
"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.",spam
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon",ham
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!,ham
Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!,ham
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.,ham
Thank..............................................,ham
"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful.",spam
"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry.",ham
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.,ham
"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.",ham
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need,ham
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature,ham
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.,spam
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",spam
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,ham
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.,spam
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.,ham
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!,ham
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .,spam

This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!,ham
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.,ham
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.,ham
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.,spam
Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.,ham
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.,ham
This is I think the best product I've bought. I already own eight that I've purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price.,ham
I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.,ham
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names.",ham

"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc.",ham
My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.,ham
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain.",ham
im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!,ham
Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.,ham
I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!,ham
Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!,ham
Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.,ham
Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.,ham
"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong.",ham
I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.,ham
"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market.",ham
Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.,ham
Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints,spam

Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.,ham
"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc",ham

Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.,ham
I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.,ham
I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.,ham
This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.,ham
We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.,spam
Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!,ham
This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so,ham
So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!,ham
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with,spam
Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one,spam
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.,ham
"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging",ham
Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.,ham
I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.,ham
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds.",ham
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,spam
"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes.",spam
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.,spam
I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.,ham
Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job,spam
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.,ham
Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.,spam
"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely.",ham
Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.,ham
"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy.",ham
"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without.",ham
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.,ham
I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better,ham
amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.,ham
"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs",ham
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it.",ham
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.,ham
Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price,ham
This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,spam
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé.",ham
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!,ham
Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.,ham
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",ham
"Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet",ham
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!",ham
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her,spam
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.,spam
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.,ham
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.,spam
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!,ham
"Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything",ham
Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.,spam
"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet.",ham
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!,spam
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!",ham
"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking.",spam
Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.,spam
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.,ham
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.,ham
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!,ham
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.,ham
Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view,spam
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.,ham
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!,spam
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,ham
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know,ham
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.,ham
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint.",spam
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",ham
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1",spam
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,",spam
"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle.",spam
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,spam
"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features...",ham
An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!,ham
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$",spam
"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product",spam
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.,ham
"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids",ham
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.,spam
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now,ham
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.,spam
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.,ham
I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.,ham
"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat.",ham
"Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email.",ham
"Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark",spam
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend,ham
I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.,spam
We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.,spam
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough.",ham
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well.",ham
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : ),ham
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.,spam
I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.,spam
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read.",spam
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.,spam
Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful,ham
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack,ham
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!",spam
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.,spam
i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net,ham
"Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now.",spam
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.,spam
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem.",ham
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.,ham
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly,ham
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.,ham

"For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great,",ham
"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.",spam
"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts.",ham
"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did.",spam
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing.",ham
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.,ham
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste.",spam
"My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun.",spam
"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.",ham
"Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages.",spam
"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it.",spam

Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!,ham
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet.",spam
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!,spam
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use.",spam
Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!,ham
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics.",ham
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.,spam
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!,spam
"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it.",ham
Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-),ham
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.,ham
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family,ham
"awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies",ham
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !,ham
I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp.,ham
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!,ham
"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet",ham
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!,ham
"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product.",ham
"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better.",ham
"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot.",spam
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.,ham
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet.",ham
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!,spam
"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!",ham
"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem.

"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution.

Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.,ham

Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.,ham
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.",spam

Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version.,spam
I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.,ham
This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.,ham
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!,spam
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,ham
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g",ham

I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.,ham
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.,spam
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge.",ham
Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.,ham

Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it.

Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size,ham

"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music.",spam
"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets.",ham
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok.",spam

I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.,ham
"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person.",spam
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.,ham
"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!",spam

It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook,spam
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!,ham
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs,ham
"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits.",ham
"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.",spam
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..,spam
Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!,ham
Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.,ham
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items.",ham
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.,spam
Good product with best price available in the market place,ham
Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.,ham

I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .,ham
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!",ham
Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading,ham
Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.,ham
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!,ham
I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you,spam

Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy!,ham
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",spam
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend.",ham
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.,ham

It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use.",ham

"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol.

An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize.

"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones.",ham

This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift.",ham
"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness.",ham

"I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!",ham
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well",ham
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend,ham
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!,spam
"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",ham
My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.,spam
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again.",ham
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.,spam

Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.",ham

"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!",spam
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube,ham
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",spam
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.,ham
Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.,spam
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it.",ham
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.,spam
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.,ham

It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips.",ham
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase.",ham

Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.,ham

"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic.",ham
I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.,ham
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.,ham
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.",spam

It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.,ham

Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",spam

I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.,ham

"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits.

I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.,spam
Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.,spam
Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!,ham
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.,spam

The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone,ham
"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",ham
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",ham
this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.,ham
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...,ham
I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.,ham

This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!,ham
"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far.",ham

"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.",ham

The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.,ham
I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.,spam

This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.,ham
i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system,ham
"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.",ham
"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time",spam
Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update,ham
"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding.",ham
Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.,ham
"This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!.",ham
"I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device.",ham
"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have.",ham
Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles,ham
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around,ham
"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped.",ham
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value.",ham
This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!,ham
Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.,ham

I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far.,spam
This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.,ham
I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!,ham
"I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value.",ham
Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.,ham
Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.,ham
First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.,ham

Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price,ham
I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.,ham
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.,spam
"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet.",ham
"Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great.",ham
Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!,ham
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!,ham
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.",ham
"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable.",ham
Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!,ham
Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.,ham

Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?,ham
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!,ham
"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.",ham
It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.,ham
"My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great.",ham
The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.,ham

"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet.",ham
Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!,ham
"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use.",spam

This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,ham

Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.,ham

Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.,ham

Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.,ham
"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!",ham
"I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet.",ham

"Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I'm a happy reader!",ham
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write",ham
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.,spam
"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't",spam
I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!,spam
Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.,ham
Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.,spam

The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.,ham
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!,ham
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.,ham
"I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor",ham
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.,spam
Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price.,ham
"Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!",ham
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.,spam
This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.,ham
"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance.",ham

"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals",ham
Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.,ham
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets.",spam
does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.,ham
"Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money.",ham
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.,ham
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.,ham
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.,ham
Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far,spam
This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!,ham
The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!,ham
"Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8"" tablet HD",ham
"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it.",ham
Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.,ham
works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.,ham
I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.,spam
"I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem.",spam
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.,ham
I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.,spam

"I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want.",spam

"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price.",spam

Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend,spam
I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.,ham

We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!,ham

BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.,ham
my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.,ham
So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it,spam
"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have.

My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.,spam
"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89.",ham
My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.,ham

"Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books",spam
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old.",ham
"I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions.",ham
Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value,spam

I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:),spam
"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money.",ham
"I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve.",ham

Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it,ham
"Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended.",ham

"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad.",ham
"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price.",ham

very good product in its price range affordable and very good,ham
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.,ham
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.,ham
I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!,ham
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",ham
Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.,ham
Great graphics for price compared to other brands.,ham
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.,spam

My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.,spam
great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend !,ham
"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults.",spam
"The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn.",ham

I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.,ham
"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds.",ham
I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!,spam
"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve.",ham
We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.,ham
At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,ham
This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!,ham
The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again,ham
"I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one.",ham
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;,spam
"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!",ham
It works great for all my needs to check my emails,spam
A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.,spam
"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!",ham
Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.,spam
"Bought this as a replacement for the 7"", faster and better display.... Best upgrade",ham
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.",spam
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table,spam
"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.",ham
upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.,ham
I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.,ham
"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too.",ham
I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.,ham
The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.,ham
"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase.",ham
"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",spam
"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc",spam
"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit.",ham
I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,spam
"I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student.",ham
"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too.",ham
"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions.",ham
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.,ham
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need",spam

"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon.",spam

"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault.",ham
"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",ham
The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.,ham
suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion,ham

"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon's OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great.",ham

"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!",ham
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,spam
"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.",spam

Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.,ham
I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's,ham
For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself.,ham
"this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more.",ham
My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.,spam
"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games.",spam
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!,ham
"I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too!",spam
"Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!",ham

"Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend",spam
Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.,ham
My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it,ham
"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size.",ham
Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it's been a good buy.,ham
Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.,ham
"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!",ham

I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ham
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.,ham
Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price,ham
I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you,spam
Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!,ham
Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities,ham

Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied,ham
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one,spam
"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use.",spam
Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.,spam
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range",ham
Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.,spam
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends,ham
"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books.",ham
"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.",ham
I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.,spam
If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...,ham
"My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,.",spam
"Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it!",ham
"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price",ham
"Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming.",ham
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.",ham
It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.,ham
Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.,ham
"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price.",ham
"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging.",spam

Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for,spam
My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them,ham
"I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself.",spam
First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.,spam
I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.,ham
"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix.",spam
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.,ham
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much.",ham
"I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc.",spam
One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.,ham

I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.,ham
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.,ham
Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.,ham
"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on.",ham
Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain,ham
Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage.,ham

"We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied.",ham
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time,ham
My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!,ham
Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.,ham
Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.,ham
"I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted.",spam
"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.",ham
"I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!",spam
"Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price!",ham
"I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time.",ham
The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet,ham
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!,ham
I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.,ham
This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.,ham
Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.,ham

I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.,spam
Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain,ham
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.,ham
This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.,spam
"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night.",ham
"I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.)",ham
"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!",ham

"The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc...",ham
I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there,ham
This product is easy to use and take along with you,ham
"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.",ham
"Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer",ham
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.",ham
"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!",ham
We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.,ham

Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.,ham
Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.,ham
The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.,spam
This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price.,ham
Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it.,ham

"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!",ham
"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!",ham
"Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free ""May Day"" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time.",ham

The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.,ham
Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!,spam
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.",spam
Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.,spam
Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.,spam

Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.,ham
Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.,spam
The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.,ham
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...",ham

"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.",ham
Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though.,ham
"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you.",spam
This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.,ham
Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.,ham

This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.,ham
Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse,ham
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,spam
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it!,ham

This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.,ham

"The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8"" tablet is just the right size.",ham
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores.",spam
My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.,spam
"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty.",ham
This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.,ham
Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.,ham
Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!,spam
"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram.",ham
Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great,ham
"Have a 7"", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great.",ham
User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.,ham

Great products as usual and great customer service,ham
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.",ham
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet,spam
This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.,ham
A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while.,ham
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.,ham

This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..,ham
My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!,spam
Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.,ham
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.,ham
"Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook.

My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use,spam
"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse",ham
"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to.",ham
Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can't beat the price.,ham
Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it,spam

"great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products.",spam
"I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!",spam
"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up.",ham
Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.,spam

Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great,ham

Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday...",spam
"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience.",ham
For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.,spam
Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!,ham
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price,ham
"For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective.",spam
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.,ham

This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!,ham
Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.,ham
"Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for "" older eyes"".",ham
"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media.",ham
"Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it",ham
This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.,ham
I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids,ham

I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire.

Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.,ham
Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again.,ham
"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",ham

The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else.",spam
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered.",spam

In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small.

Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids.",ham

"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android.",spam
This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.,spam

"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one.",spam
"Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage",ham
"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already.",ham
This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.,ham
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,spam

Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.,ham
"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus.",ham
"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad.",spam
Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.,spam

"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld.",spam
"This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping!",spam
I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem,spam
"Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it's hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors.",spam
"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",ham
"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games.",ham
I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!,ham
One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely!,ham
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,ham
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.,spam

Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).,spam
"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer.",spam

Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money.",ham

the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.,ham
"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it",spam
Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it,ham

After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!",ham

"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.",ham
Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money.,ham
I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it,ham
"HD 8"" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included.",ham

"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price.",spam

Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.,ham
We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.,ham
"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.",ham
I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price.,ham
"I needed something that's not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it's not iPad, but it's good for a tablet)",spam

Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo!,ham

It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing?

Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.,spam

I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid.

Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.,ham
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,ham
"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it.",ham
This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday,ham
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt.",ham
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.,ham
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.,ham
"I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.",spam
"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!",spam
"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.",ham
easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.,ham
"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues.",ham
"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere .",spam
"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!",ham
"Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it.",spam
Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.,ham
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.",spam
Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.,ham
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,spam
"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",ham
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking,ham
"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.",ham
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.,spam
This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -,ham
"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",spam
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs.",ham
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp.",ham
Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.,ham
"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it.",spam
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",ham
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle,spam
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.",spam
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers,ham
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy.",ham
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.",ham
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.",ham
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.,spam
"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!",ham
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels",ham
"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading",ham
Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.,ham
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",ham
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",ham
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",ham
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",spam
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.,ham
Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.,ham
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly.",ham
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.",spam
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",spam
Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable,ham
"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",spam
"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",ham
"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",spam
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.,ham
"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",ham
"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",spam
Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.,spam

"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.",ham
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.",ham
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!",ham
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.,spam
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.,ham
"Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!",spam
"Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more",ham
"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",spam
"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!",ham
"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",ham
"I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle.

"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",ham

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",ham

"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",ham

Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br /br /The so-so:br /The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",ham
"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:br /br /My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.br /br /Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.br /br /The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.br /br /I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.br /br /The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.br /br /For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",ham
"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",ham
I use to hate to read but now that I have my Kindle and I can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better I love to read.,ham

"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.",ham
Great. Love it.,ham
"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more",ham
"This thing has captured my wife's heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with.",ham
"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product",ham

"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",ham

"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well.

I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.,spam
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.",spam
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up.",ham
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.,spam
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music.",spam
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE",ham
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.,ham
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.,spam
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!,ham
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.,ham
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,spam
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.",spam

Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.,ham
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air,ham
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.,ham
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.,spam
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.",spam
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.",ham
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load",spam
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free,spam
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear.",ham
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",spam
This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.,ham
I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....,spam
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.,ham
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7"".",ham
Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.,spam
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.,spam
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone,spam
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!",ham

Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad,ham
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.,ham
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",ham
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient.....",ham
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,spam
This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading,ham
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage.",ham
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.,ham
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",ham
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",ham

This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy.

Very pleasant buying experience.,ham
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!",ham

I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,spam
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!,spam
Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.,spam
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!,ham
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.,spam

Most buyers will have a phone or other charger that will work so you probably don't need to buy this.,ham
very good,ham
So far this product has worked great. I bought it to replace my kindle charger that was no longer charging my older kindle fire. I bought a new USB cord as well. It charges my kindle so much faster than any of the other chargers I have. I would definitely recommend this product.,spam

Perfectly packaged with that hi-tech mojo. Works as advertised,ham
"I mean... it work fine, but 20 fine There's nothing special here and it's a joke that Amazon doesn't just ship a charging plug with the Kindle in the first place. You should be able to find plenty of non-OEM chargers that'll work in terms of watts and voltage for far less money, like 5.",ham
Perfect,ham
turns out this was not necessary ... being returned.,ham
It works.,spam
"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!",ham
Needed a new one.. the dog ate my old one,ham

This is working very well so far.,ham
I wish this came in white to match my Kindle Paperwhite,ham
What can I say about the plug....it is great. Now I have the option of using the plug to charge my Apple ipod or using my USB cord and adapter that charges my pod directly into the wall port. I do prefer the plug though.,spam

Q: What's the difference between a 19.99 Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Supply and a 5.95 5V 1A (1000mA) USB port power supply - UL ListedA: 14.04 Calling it a 5W charger rather than a 5V 1A charger is a distinction without a difference.,ham
"Personally, I think the Kindle should have come with this item as 99 of people would need this. It works fine.",ham

"I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative.",spam

I don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. I just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. It's probably the new Kindle's problem but I'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. I charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. So go ahead and buy this adapter,spam
good item,ham
this is way over priced,ham
"works, that is all that counts",ham
So helpful to power up our readers anywhere.,spam
Works well for what it is intended for.,spam
Didn't really need this but it came in a kit with my kindle. Can never have too many.,ham

Working as expected,ham
Does what it is suppose to do - power adaptor / charger.Three stars because it's overpriced.,spam

My 2nd one. They work great.,ham
As d scribed,ham
"It's fine, but not necessary. Had I known that I could charge my Kindle with my tablet and/or phone charging cord I would not have bought it.",spam
"The power cord works well however, I am still trying to see if I made a mistake in buying the 5. I love its size but it should have better functions then the older models or I just don't get it.. I should know because this is my 10 th Kindle.",spam
"Functional, but be sure the the USB cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection.",ham
Exactly what I expected!,ham
quick easy to use,spam
This is a fairly standard item for use with wall/standard US AC plugs. It is well designed and will meet your charging needs when connected to the required USB cable.,ham
"Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket.",ham
Pretty dumb that you have to.buy a charger port,spam
Purchased this for my kindle and it does what it's intended to do. Quality looks fine as well.,spam

I like this item it suits my needs.,ham
"Received on time, and works great . I think this is a great product. And thanks for your customer service.",ham
It is only a USB 5 Watt charger. Had now issues with the actual unit as it produced 4.6 watts on a check load but comparing it to what is available to do the same thing there are cheaper options. So minus one star for over priced and that it doesn't come with a cable,spam
Great product!!,ham
Works,ham
"I ordered this power charger at the same time I ordered my new E Reader. It works great, very fast. I was disappointed that it was an add on and not included with the price of the reader.",ham
Good product!,ham
Page turner. I would have given 5 stars. A little disappointed with the ending.,ham
Works as good as the original,ham
What Can I Say 120 volts goes in one end and 5 volts comes out the other. WOW! High quality.,ham
Just what I wanted and expected.,ham
My old kindle charger works fine - that wasn't clear when I bought a new kindle white. And now you want to charge me 6.95 to send it back. Forget it!! I'll keep the extra charger,spam
I returned this with the reader in the same box.,ham
It's a very nice charger it's fast and effective.,ham
It fine. I wasn't aware of what I was purchasing at the time but thought that I would need it in order to charge my book. Turns out I have several of them already from other electronics. Didn't really need it.,spam

Good charger,ham
Completely satisfied. Works as it should.,spam

This was purchased for my Kindle and I like it! Makes it easy to recharge it wherever I am. Recommend this product!,spam
Not much to say except that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.,spam

Works fine. Carol,ham
A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.,ham
Very happy with my purchase,ham
Great works as expected,ham
"I got this as part of a Prime Day kindle bundle, and it works just fine. However, there doesn't appear to be any difference between this charger and the 5 other ones I have, all of which were much cheaper. If it wasn't part of the bundle I purchased, I would have never purchased this by itself.",ham
Should be included with the Kindle.,ham
"Works just fine, but a bit on the expensive side!",ham
Good solid adaptor to fit the Kindle Paperwhite.,ham
I will know which charger is mine,ham

woks fine,ham
thanks for an excellent transaction,ham
Excelente !!,ham

Good charger.,ham
Im still not sure why this doesn't come with the Kindle - and Im glad I threw it in the shopping cart when I purchased my Kindle.,ham
good Quality,ham

I'm writing a review based on the problem I had with my Kindle HD 8.9 it would not hold a charge even though Amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it wouldn't come on so I'm just want to say that the charger does work when I plugged it into my Samsung phone with the power cord so that's why I give it 5 stars,spam
really good charger,ham
handy,ham
Nice to have a charger that works quickly.,ham
Part of gift,spam
Good product.,ham
"This charger FRIED my Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy J7. DO NOT plug your other devices up to it!!! It easily comes detached from the Fire tablet but does charge it. I'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. There are young children in my home and they know the difference between Apple and Android charging tips. So they will use any available charging cable they find when needed.",spam

I like it.,spam

"A must-have if you have any Kindle or Fire products! This definitely charges things much faster, and is great to have in several locations for convenience, especially if people tend to borrow your chargers.",spam
I already have one am sending it back,spam
I think the cord needs to be a bit longer. This would enable you to read while charging.,ham
Nice product. Works well.,ham
"Does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive",spam
"Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle.",ham
Best,ham
It works great.,spam
"If you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall, and then plug the big end of the USB cable into the non-prongy side, and then plug the little end of the USB cable into your Kindle, it makes books magically appear on the screen.

Incredibly fast tablet charger. Works as advertised without any issues.,ham

"Works wonderfully, charges quickly.",ham
It does the job.,ham
Great product. Thank you,ham
works great for my kindle paper white but the seond kindle that I ordered will cot turn on,ham
The charger won't stay securely connected to the Paperwhite and wiggles. It will only charge when held at a particular angle.,ham
Nice and compact. Better than the older models.,ham
"This is great. So many things come with a plug that is to go into your laptop. I got this so I can plug it into the wall. I had Kindle chargers for my kindle, but I'm getting more and more things that have to be charged through your laptop. Not me...I use this plug.",spam
Does exactly what it is supposed to do,spam
Perfect.,ham
it works that what counts,spam

First rate - high quality!,ham
I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.,ham
"Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all.",ham
"What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time.",spam
The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again,ham

This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily.,spam
Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.,ham
It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!,ham
Very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle,ham
I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,spam
I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.,spam
"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",ham
I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month,ham
"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light.",ham
Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend,ham
The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!,ham
"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon.",ham
The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.,ham
Great buy! Bought it to replace a first generation Kindle.,ham
"Perfect size, so easy to carry around. Long lasting battery life. Would reccomend!",ham
Easy to use and similar to using a book. Love it! I would buy again!,spam
"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version",ham

FOR ITS SIZE IF OK THE VALUE MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE USE IT ALL THE TIME,ham
In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.,ham
I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!,ham
I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.,spam
My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,spam
The Amazon Kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. The device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.,ham

"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one.",spam
"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",spam
It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...,ham

Great way to read books available for downloads from the library,ham
"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!",ham
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",spam
There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.,ham
"After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore.",spam
this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle.everything is touch screen and is faster than before,ham
This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.,ham
"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use.",ham
"I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!",ham
Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.,ham

I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it.",ham
Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.,ham
This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.,ham
"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light.",ham
"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come",ham
I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.,ham
I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.,spam
"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product.",ham

"Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. These Kindles are great (and inexpensive) for that purpose.",ham
"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement",ham
If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.",spam
Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,ham

My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!,ham

"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this.",ham
Item work well and was easy to read from in day light,spam
This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark,ham

My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.,spam
purchased for my child to read - works as expected and for the price it was a good option,ham
"I really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when I purchased it. It's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. It has the look of book in that sense. I was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go.",ham
I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me,spam
The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,ham
"My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!",ham
"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed.",spam
"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle.",ham
"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight",ham
"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.",ham
Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read,spam
"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee.",ham
It was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. She has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.,spam
"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",ham
Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around,ham
"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend.",spam
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..,ham
It allows me to read without using space in my phone.,spam

It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright,spam

My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome.,ham

"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",ham
This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.,ham
"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.",spam
"I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands",spam
I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!,ham

easy for my kids - 8 and 11 to use the kindle for night time reading,ham
First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi,ham
"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.",ham
easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. battery life is a +,ham
"I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon.",spam
So simple to set up a caveman could do it and still have time to get some reading in!,spam
Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.,ham

This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,ham
This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun.,ham
Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.,ham
I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge,ham
"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",spam
"It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking.",spam
Love the new Kindle. Priced right. Perfect size. Take it with me everywhere.,ham
Very easy basic e book reader. Good for beginners to start,ham
It is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! The background has the same look as the pages of a real book.,spam
Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .,ham
"What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much.",ham
"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly.",ham
"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",ham
If you are into reading then this is for you. I didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. Great for reading outside.,ham
This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.,ham
I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.,ham

Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. She is starting her first series,spam
"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.",ham
Good product for child. Who only need to read the books,ham
"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.",ham
"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model.",ham
Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.,spam
"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device",ham
"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me.",ham
I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,spam
"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",ham
"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet",spam
"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books.",spam
If you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.,ham
"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.",ham
"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use.",spam
"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun.",ham

This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me,ham
Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.,ham
I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.,spam
Got it to gift to my friend. Absolutely loved it. Good value.,spam
Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.,ham
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.,ham
I love this kindle! It's a life saver when I'm bored at the doctors office!,ham
i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading,ham
Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM,ham
"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem.",ham
I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!,ham
Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access,spam
Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend,ham
Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book,spam

The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.,ham
I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !,ham
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.,ham
Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches,spam
"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work",spam
"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",ham
easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift,ham
I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.,ham

"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library.",ham
The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that,ham
First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.,spam

"UPDATE: I bought both a Fire HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more",ham
"I just received my kindle fire today. I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite. I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading. I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks. It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info. The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace) in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, 11/22/63.I also tested out the text to speech. It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be. I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television. The offers only show on the startup, no big deal. I already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway. So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements. I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.Read more",ham
"I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter. Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work. Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD. We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat. Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. Their customer service is incredible! The Kindle Fire itself is amazing. The internet is fast connects perfectly to all wi-fi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly. I'm always reading. My husband checks the sports scores. My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family.",ham
"My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it. He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her. She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. So now we're up to 194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012*** Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills. While I'm sure folks are well intentioned (sarcasm), I don't recall asking for parenting advice. Many have said it's ridiculous to buy an eReader for a child who can't read.Read more",spam

If you just want a tablet that gets the job done. Then here you go.,ham
"I picked up this tablet when it was on sale. It wasn't a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an iPad. But for the price, the tablet is very powerful. With Amazon prime I could do much more than I expected. My complaint is that the front facing camera zooms too much on your face. Also, there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve. But it is definitely worth buying as a backup tablet.",spam
"This is the third fire in our house now and they're all solid, if unspectacular. For $40, the hardware can't be beat, but this newest version of the operating system is very clunky and not intuitive in the least. Once you get over th leading curve though, it's a good way to keep the boy quiet on a plane",ham

My daughter fell in love with it instantly best ever,spam

"I like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. The colors are vibrant and crisp. It plays videos well. I love the Amazon Underground absolutely free apps and games. The only drawback for me is the Amazon modified Android OS. I'm slowly figuring it out. The cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason I bought this. It is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. I also bought the tempered glass screen protector.",ham
"I am enjoying my Amazon seven inch tablet. It is fast paced with good graphics and long battery life. The main problem is that the volume is lower than other tablets. Still,great deal for the price.",ham

The Fire was the perfect answer for an inexpensive and easy to operate device to keep her in the loop with all the upcoming events. The Fire is easy to operate and wasn't too intimidating like a laptop or desktop. Mom has caught right on and is using it daily. Great choice for a beginner. Very happy it's working for her.",ham
LIMITED CAPACITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A VERY GOOD BUY,ham
"The apps I really want it won't let me download. I don't like that I HAVE to sign up for ""One Click"" with a credit card.",spam

I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.,spam
For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.,ham
This is a great first tablet for kids. Lots of game and the battery life is good!,ham

"I got this as an upgrade for my old kindle & I love the new features! Crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations & tabs. Well organized. They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu. All around great product in my opinion.",ham
Its a beginner tablet. Not so great interface. I prefer larger size tablet,ham
Bought the new for Father's Day. Works well sometimes have to reset it to connect to Internet. All the apps are easy to access.,ham
i mean if you want just a tablet to read some books and browse internet thats fine.,ham
This tablet is great for games and books. Good size for travel.,ham
"I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the tablet. I had watched the prices go up and down on Amazon. I wish I had bought one when they were $29.99. I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later. I have been using my Kindle touch for that. If you do buy this tablet I would suggest getting a memory card.",ham
I use it for games and movies...its great..good picture quality....great sound...could use more storage space..but i guess thats why they make sd cards...,spam

This is a great tablet for the price. Works great and is easy to operate.,ham
This tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share (ages 4-8). Their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. It was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the Amazon App Store. Screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick! Our only regret is that we didn't buy the 3-pack so that they each could have their own instead of sharing! Great performance value and much appreciated gift!,ham

the description sounded like the base unit was included with the coding game - which it was not.,ham
"Good for what it is supposed to be- not a high-end iPad for sure, but for the price, can't beat it. Gift for my son, a low risk way to acclimate him to tablets, but not a big loss if he destroys it.

Not really much to say here but it does the job. I'm not use to the Amazon store as I am with the Google store but I can live with it. This was a spur of the moment but where I wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot. And so far it has been my traveling buddy. For the price it is good and does what it should without to many compromises; ( ads) if your not looking for a lot nice stop.,spam

"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",ham

"I was amazed how little it cost to get a Kindle Fire these days. I passed down my iPad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and I just wanted something to watch Netflix and read books.

"All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)",spam
Not a bad tablet for the price. Iris skittle different from other tablet brands,ham

I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it.

About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet.

"The price on this is great. There are a couple of issues I have with my Kindle but I think it's me not the device. Sometimes when I shut it off I have to hold down the power button as the box that comes up that says ok or cancel does not work for me. The other problem I have is sometimes it does not go back to where I left off in a book. I took it to the store and the tech I had look at it did not have these problems. Other that that I love it. I can travel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email, movies and books. I purchased a case for it that sets it up so I don't have to hold it and that made me like it even more.",ham

Personally I download alot of game apps so i need lots of memeory but for my mother in law its just fine. She likes to read books on it, she says its good for that. Also she was able to get the libraries app and download free books so thats a plus.",spam

"I currently own 3 Kindles, including this one, so I am very familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets. I love that this new Fire has updated the look and feel. I can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so I can take them with me when I'm on the go and don't picture, which I love! So for $50, it's a great value. There are only 2 things that I wish this Kindle had: there is no sleep/wake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my TV, but again, for the price it's a great product.",ham
"Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!",ham
I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire but would have liked a bigger screen model. Good for playing games.,ham
"Kindle is good. I got one for my husband and sister. They are really enjoying them. It is easy to use for someone who never used one. My reason for not giving 5 stars was completely due to my best buy experience. I live in a small town and drove thirty miles to get to best buy only to find they were completely out. Asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.I wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.I was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them. They would not do that. I had to drive another 50 miles to pick one up. Just thought best buy should have tried to be more accommodating, but it was Christmas shopping season.",spam
"Bought 2 of these on sale for my grandkids. They love them & they seem to work good. One tablet goes to school the other, if it lasts until next school year, will be going to school also. Good tablet for the money.",ham
"The Amazon Fire pad is a great deal for the price. It works great very responsive, does exactly what I want it to do like Netflix, Google and a few games. It doesn't suck :)",ham
Great little tablet would have got Five stars if you could use it with chromcast,spam

"This tablet is simple and easy to use. The only problem I've had is putting in a memory card. The tablet kept pushing it back out, had to read reviews online in order to input it properly.",ham
Too many advertisements to get through. A little tough to adjust to coming from the apple world.,ham
Price great for quality and versatility. Bought for son to use for streaming movies and reading books. Great product for him but had to purchase extended memory miniSd card.,ham
Great tablet works very good and the price is cheap.,ham
Keeps my kids busy while I cook & when in the car.,ham
Kept my kids busy on road trip & while I cook daily,ham
Decent tablet for the price. Expect just basic use and function. This is no iPad be sure you aren't expecting that.,ham
"After opening several gifts on Christmas, my 8 year old grandson kept going back to this gift and playing with it. He was very pleased. He loves his Kindle Fire and plays games and does his homework with it too!",spam
Best tablet and most affortable. Love that it just works. Must have Prime.,spam
I purchased this item for my 10 year old son and he loves it. He is able to download books and any kind of games that he likes.,ham
The Amazon Fire offers the same access to online resources as the much more expensive IPad and functions just as well.,ham
Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.,ham
"We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)",ham
Purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. She loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. She loves the device and the pink color; I loved the price and the fast delivery .,ham
This tablet for ~$35 is an amazing deal. It's almost a no-brainer to get one for any long family trip.,ham
I bought this for my four year old nephew. He is enjoying it.,ham
tablet was easy to set up and get started. 80 year old mother loves it!,spam
"BOUGHT ON BLACK FRIDAY FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE THOUGHT I PAID 100.00 MORE FOR IT. IT DOES A LOT. SHE LOVES IT.",spam
"I love every thing about the product and transaction, no complaints at all. I love that its affordable and does about every thing you would have need of.",ham
"Since today society is hi-tech savvy, it was only right to get this for my 4 yr old grandson. It's an awesome tablet!",ham
"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!",spam
I love the kindle. My kids love playing their Disney movies on it. They also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. I highly recommend!,ham
"There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read. The operating system is Amazon's version of Android. Audio is adequate. WiFi and Bluetooth work well.",ham
The tablet is easy to set up and easy to use. Great tablet for family use.,ham
"My daughter always want one, she got this one, she love it.",ham
I was worried at first since it was cheap but I'm loving it more and more everyday. In fact I went out and bought another for a Christmas gift for a family member. Easy gift. And you can use HBO go and Netflix. The only negative is there was no blue tooth. Just a FYI it's the 5th gen 8g amazon fire,ham
"This gift was a stocking stuffer. For the price, I paid, wonderful. The recipient loved it! :)",ham
"Had one of these 2 years ago, got this one on sale and I usually pay more for a dinner. Does everything you need and plus you can expand the memory.",ham
The product was overall worth the money spent. Love it !!!,ham
"I love the color is choose,and the tablet is great",ham
"I have had this product for about a year now, and I am still very pleased with my purchase. I am able to read books, surf the web, listen to music, watch videos, and more. Unbelievable price for everything you can do on this tablet.",ham
My daughter loves it and you can't beat the warranty!,ham
I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.,ham
"To me, this is an AMAZING little device. I suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. Downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable--my home internet connection is not the greatest. But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook. The graphic on games amaze me. If you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, I think this is a great choice. I'm considering getting one for my sister.",ham
"This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!",ham
"It's just what I was looking for, something simple and inexpensive. Plus I got it for $35 on black friday.",spam
"Purchased this for my grandson. He loves it, especially the front/rear camera.",ham
Great tablet and perfect for the kids. I will be going back to buy more of these at this price!,ham
I love that even great quality product like this is available to masses who can actually afford them. The table does it job really good. And i'm happy with my purchase.,spam
"Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance.",ham
"I bought this because of the low price on Black Friday. My aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original Kindle. And, I have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. Thrilled I bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. The light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me.",ham
This is a great product . I bought it for my grandsons 12th birthday. It was super easy for him to monuva. He loves it,ham
"Clunky and full of ads. Ok for my kids to use for games, but I wouldn't use this for myself.",ham
Love it very much thanks. I use my table for banking,spam
This is the second Fire tablet for $35 that I purchased this season. They are a great value and Best Buy has been a great place to buy them,ham
"1st tablet,easy to use and set up.plenty of apps preloaded to start.",spam
For the price tag of $59 bucks u can't go wrong....,ham
Bought this for myself at Christmas as a replacement for my older version. This one has clearer graphics but I find the build to be way cheaper and definitely a great deal thinner..felt to flimsy to me.,ham
I bought this as a Christmas gift and my sister loves it! Great price on Black Friday as well!,ham
i bought this for someone for a gift for xmas. this is a good simple tablet for someone to being with.,ham
Bery good product for the price. Can't beat it. Id recommend buying this for a first time tablet.,ham
It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.,ham
"I purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap. I'm not impressed with anything about it. It is slow, not at all user friendly, and the advertising is so very annoying. It is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps I use on a regular basis. I will keep it only to access my amazon accounts.",spam
I bought two and gave them as gifts to a couple new to tablets. They love the FIRE tablet. now I think I am going to get one to play my games on. I currently have the iPad air.,ham
"Looking for a desent product , best buy had black Friday tablets for $34.99, what a great bargain. I had to buy four of them for my grandkids. Just the look on thier faces when they opened, was a great joy for me.",ham
Compact. Easy to hold Great for playing games. Easy to use keyboard,ham
This is a great tablet for the right price. I bought two of these tablets as gifts to my sons. They were pleased.,ham
I bought the tablet black Friday. Best buy had the same price as amazon. So I got it. The tablet was a gift for someone else. the recipient to this day insists that I should have gotten one for myself.,ham
This tablet is a perfect size and very sturdy. Has an expandable memory slot. Perfect for my needs.,ham
Great tablet and excellent for kids also. I have been recommending to everyone,ham
Amazing device. I got it for 35 bucks on Black Friday. Plays all games the kids want. Snappy and fast. Great for kids and adults. Love the Amazon kindle.,ham
The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.,ham
Good tablet for traveling and reading on the road.,ham
It has a multiple futures for kids and parental control that you can setup for your kids. Even you can control usage of tablet for your kids,spam
Great tablet for a beginner to get used to the technology,ham
"My son is not gentle and has managed to destroy a few other, more expensive, tablets. I bought this for a fraction of what the other tablets cost and it works great. He loves it.",spam
Amazing price and awesome for a tablet for children. My 6 & 13 year old nieces love them,ham
I bought this for my youngest to read and play. Awesome!,ham
"Wow. I've had many tablets, but none come close to this for the price. The screen is clear and responsive. While it comes locked to amazon, i sideloaded the nook app without root, and then rooted it easily, just for fun. XDA has the details.",ham
"Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!",ham
"Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras.",spam
Was easy to set up and very easy to use. For a basic tablet I would recommend it.,spam
Much better than I expected for the very reasonable price.,ham
Very nice product...Had everything we were looking for...,ham
"I've had the old 6"" HD Amazon tablet which I use with the students at the school where I teach. Got this 7"" tablet on my first day at this job to keep at home and use. The larger real estate of this tablet is fantastic...along with the new version of the OS.",ham
Great price and product. i bought 2 for my nieces. This is very practical and does the same as the more expensive one's.,ham
"If you want the combination of a kindle for reading as well as some of the features of a tablet, this is an excellent value for the price. I like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book I am reading and my email or other web uses.It seems like the battery discharges rather quickly compared to my other kindle. I often keep this one plugged in while I am using it.",ham
I am impressed with the quality of the Amazon Fire for the price,ham
it very easy to work and does very good good games my child loves it he not but 4 and finds his way around on it,ham
"For $50 you cant go wrong, there are other no name brands that cost more that are worst. Didn't need to put much thought into buying one. Great christmas gift for anyone of all age groups.",spam

"This is a Great little unit for the price! Pretty quick with the four processors, good apps as well. Very pleased!",ham
apps constantly fail to open. no flash for camera. hard to download anything not amazon ie: google apps. will be returning....,spam
this tablet works great for note taking at school.,ham
Purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it. Ended up buying another after a day of using the device.Pros:- Fast boot time- Clear & sharp display- Long battery life- Light weightCons:- Adds on lock screen- Inability to remove apps from the home screen (Can only move them to a folder)- Screen shows more fingerprints then say an Ipad or Nexus deviceOverall this has been a great device and hasnt had any issues. I play Game of War on the device and watch Hulu/Netflix for the majority of my use. For an Ebook is it smaller but does the job.,ham
I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.,spam
A very good tablet with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.,ham
STILL IN SHOCK ALL THE TABLET CAN DO FOR $50!ITS A NO BRAINER,ham
Nice size easy to use for little people. Long lasting battery,spam

I bought this for my grandson and he likes it a lot He is only 5 years old and it is perfect size for him He wanted a red one but likes the blue.We put abc mouse on it and he is able to find it for himself. Great price,ham
"The Charger is not lasting, Screen is ok,Functionality good. size to small but for the price is ok.Worst thing is the charger and battery life.",ham
Birthday gift for wife. Her other tablet battery only lasts a hour. She wanted another one. Great tablet for the price.,ham
Easy to read books. Great for night reading. Easy to download books,ham
"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though. My girlfriend has an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one. Still, a nice alternative for browsing/shopping/bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery.",spam
"Great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging. It comes pre loaded with loads of apps and has a nice feel in the hands. screen quality is nice, the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it takes the kindle to start up and shut down, it can get annoying at times. i have a 2 yo and 8yo and its held up great, dropped on cement and no cracks.",ham
This item is great got for my sister as a birthday gift. She uses it for reading and music,ham
Great product at a great price. Gave out as Safety recognition gifts.,ham
"Bought the Kindle for xmas gift,the young lady really loves it she reads books on it.",spam
I bought this for my daughter during the holidays and after four months of use it would no longer would charge. I tried other charges as well and it's definitely the tablet. Now I have to go through the hassle of seeing if I can still replace it under warranty.,ham
"This is our family's 3rd fire tablet, great, affordable solution for our family",ham
excellent value for the price. Tablet works well for my 9 year old!,ham
Goog!I would recommend this to a friend!!!I like it,ham
"Please don't let the cheap price of this tablet fool you. I can do a lot with it: surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games, etc. There's an issue with the volume of Amazon Fire 7 (not quite loud enough for me even when I turn the volume to its max). But I think I still did a great decision to buy it. Good product overall.",spam
Good tablet for general use. Easy to add apps. Good battery lifetime.,spam
"I love my Amazon Fire, it's easy to download books, fun to read and I use it to catch up on my Facebook and email accounts.",spam
My tablet works very well purchased.one for a friend she brought a sd card for more storage space having problems with it tells her not enough storage space,spam
Works great! Purchased as holiday gift for 80 year old grandmother.,ham
The young girl and boy that I bought the units for in Nigeria for school use just love them the price was great and they are being put to good use.,ham
meets or exceeds all my needs simple and fun for games. looking forward to reading my first book,spam
I wish it were a little bit bigger but it's just right for what I need. It's light weight and compact. Very easy to use and priced very reasonably!,ham
It works great for what I need. Not a fan of ads and that it sends e-mails of all the apps I download. But I just use it for a few apps.,spam
"I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot. This version of the Fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.The new OS seems to work well in spite of the ""commercial"" aspect. After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable. This feature was not a surprise but what I would expect in a device from Amazon and its ecosystem.The Kindle Fire is an excellent 7-inch tablet for its $50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby.",ham
Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.,ham
Great tablet for a beginner to catch up on reading.,ham
great price and great birthday gift for my son.no complaints so far. my son & his sister enjoy playing games and watching videos.,ham
I liked this product and its very good for daily use.,ham
we bought this for my 11 year old daughter and we love it. So easy to set up and use. Much better than the one made especially for kids. This one has better capabilities.,ham
I've purchased Kindle Fire in the past for our girls and they loved them (literally) to pieces. They lasted 2 years before cracked screens meant replacement was necessary. These new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement was easy! They work great and the girls are happy.,ham
"I had to buy this Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black, as the price was right.What a great device. I did not expect it to perform the way it has. I have streamed video, read books and installed a 64GB sdcard i had laying around. Great for travel, due to the price I really have not lost anything if it is lost or damaged.",ham
"Giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier!! Great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!",ham
"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",ham
"Great features and for an excellent price. I bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. It allows me to control what features he can use, Apps, books, videos, etc. He used an Android one (my wife's) before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used.",spam
For having a discount for this price it was a deal i couldn't pass up. Even when everywhere seems to be sold out of this item i was still able to find best buy mobile had them in stock. Makes a great stocking stuff.,ham
This tablet is very easy to use and a perfect size.,ham
Great value for the price grabbed 2 of these for the kiddos. They are capable of playing games and with the know how you can put Google play store on them.,ham
This tablet was purchased for a gift given to a friend with no prior experience using a tablet. The tutorial given in the beginning made it simple to understand.,ham
Great product. It was on sale and I didn't think it was going to be great but it was,spam
Seems smaller than the older version but it still does the job. User friendly.,spam
Got them as birthday presents for my grandsons and love them,ham
Very pleased with the tablet. This is our fourth one we have owned.,ham
"I love the ability to pick and choose magazines, books and more at my leisure. Also love being a prime member and getting a free new book each month as well as 1000s of other selections from Kindle Unlimited! LOVE!",ham

"I'm a proud owner of 2 kindles and 3 kindle fires, my entire family loves them. I love how child friendly they are.",ham
.great for small children.. Easy to set up and use,ham
I purchased it to read books and I love the fact that I can play games on it also. Works fine and is easy to use and for the price I do not think you can go wrong.,ham
I think this tablet is very easy to use. It is price well.,ham
How can you complain about anything this food for this cheap?,ham
"great for the price, did research and found this #",ham
"I 'm very please with the tablet haven't had any problem. It does everything I need it to do. I would recomend it.,",spam
Bought for friend so could have face time with grandbaby.,ham
I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift. It is a great tablet for a great price!,ham
My 6 year old got one last year and it's very good,spam
Best Tablet under $50. It works great with a perfect size to hold in hand. Great deal.,ham
Works good for price. My kid likes it very much. Good value for money,ham
I have the happiest grandson ever. Which makes me the best grandma ever!!,ham
"For $50 this table was a no brainer. It's fantastic. Light, good battery life and I get the apps that I want/need.I am not a fan of the Silk browser, but I didn't buy this to surf. I bought it to read books and watch Netflix. It works perfectly for that. It's so good, I bought 2.",spam
I have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am I glad I did. Tablet runs faster than I thought and has a very good display. If you can't afford an Ipad get this!,ham
"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung.",ham
The tablet has good versatility and is an excellent device for young children.,ham
have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black Friday for 34.99. got 2 more.,ham
The tablet exceeded my expectations for $35. Kids love to play games on it and is great for social media.,ham
"Bought this during the black friday sale for $35 and can't complain at all. Keeps my kids busy, and runs hearthstone, that's all I need.",ham
"We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great. We can really only run the internet and Facebook on this device. Will be returning and getting a different tablet.",ham
"This is the third one in our house. It's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails",ham
I bought two of these as gifts for Christmas. One for my mom and one for a 9 yr. old. I'm a tech geek so I think these are great to introduce to and older parent or small kid just because of the price alone (Not for us tech guru's). I got them on black Friday for $34.99. Great e reader and awesome for games like candy crush. Only downside is the 8gb but for $34.99 that's not even an issue!,ham
My wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy I'm happy!!!,spam
So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:,spam
"For the price that I paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. It does exactly what i bought ir for",ham
Good product great price.best buy rep was good help,ham
My kids love them and they have yet to break them! Unlike some others I've tried that cost twice as much.,ham

Love the great deal on this tablet. Black friday deal,ham
"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. Free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. School websites dont work. Wish I had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase.",spam
"What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made.",ham
Bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good!,ham
This is perfect for my 2 year old. I love the option for 2 accounts...the kid account is very streamline.,ham

I love that I can have the convenience of my laptop and my games in a small tablet.,ham
The weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling,ham
"Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying. Can't change or hide any preloaded features. Can't complain much for the price and the fact that I won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced.",ham
"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for.",spam
The Whispersync technology that allows a child to read a book and listen to the audio book while it highlights the words is an indispensable tool for young readers.,ham
"I have really enjoyed this device. It works very well. Only thing I was disappointed with was that when I bought it the cashier at Best Buy said if I found it cheaper in another store, or online that would give me the difference in the money. I did find it cheaper online but the manager refused to give me the difference of $15. I suggested they not tell customers they would honor a cheaper price when they won't really do it.",ham
"Bought this as a gift as I was on a budget, I figured it would be okay but I got say it is actually faster than my iPad Air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps",spam
"If you want a tablet to perform basic functions, you can't do any better than the Kindle Fire 7. Check email, social media, surf the web, download and read ebooks with no problems. Good battery life.",spam
I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.,ham
"Overall this seems to be a good tablet, but I wish it used the Google Play store as well as the Amazon apps, because I can't get the Target Cartwheel without paying.",ham

We bought these a Christmas for our 3 children they have been a great present the kids really enjoy them,ham
"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet.",spam
I bought this tablet to replace my daughters Nook. She loves it. It's great for on the go.,ham
This is fast and good size for the kids no fit the big ones but still a good option,ham

"Wonderful, so glad I got it. Great for reading. Child restrictions are a plus.",ham
Very nice tablet for the price. Built in storage is limited but easily expandable with a microSD card. The Freetime app for kids is excellent. Overall I would recommend this tablet.,ham
Have now had for a month and I have to say the speed of this tablet is good. Really no lag on browsing. Only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. But for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.,ham
We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones,ham
"I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air.",ham
kids love it...only issue that bothered me is that my reduced price came with ads that in order to be removed i had to pay money. other than that good product,spam

"I purchased 2 of these for my 4 & 5 year old grandsons as a Christmas present. They loved them! Easy to use, great screens & volume!",ham
"Gave this as a gift to my husband. He likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. He's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. That's frustrating.",spam
Perfect little tablet for my son for Christmas. The price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. In addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. He's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!,ham
The Kindle Fire is great for those that are looking for a tablet to use with WiFi and is even better for those that have Amazon Prime. Makes watching your favorite shows and listening to music very easy. Magazines look great as well.,ham
Tablet work like charm and I never have issues with it,ham

The screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. It seems built fairly well and for 39$, I'm happy.",ham
"My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works",spam
"Bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. Both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. Price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. Plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids.",ham
easy to use. looks good. The prize winner was very pleased.,spam
"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!",ham
This tablet is a good started tablet for children.,ham
Very simple setup and a great little item for the price.,ham
"I think this is a great product/ solution, especially for the price. I needed to replace my portable DVD player. I have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. After looking at my options I decided on getting them both a Kindle for about the same price of 1 DVD player. HEADS UP: The Disney Anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. You have to access it through Amazon movies in order to download them. I got a MicroSD card to store the movies on and so far so good! They held up, supplied games, movies and when there is Wi-Fi they can play ABCMouse to get some learning in there too. Great buy. Good luck getting those movies downloaded :)",ham
"Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them.",ham

"I had been searching for a reliable and durable tablet for my child, after various reviews I went through with purchasing a pair of the kindle fires. For my child it is perfect, he's able to play games and videos without much issues. Being a young child durability is required as was low cost, this item has more than met expectations. For an adult it is more a passable option as the os can be frustrating and the unit will lag on occasion.",ham
"I'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 iOS devices in the last five years. Honestly, the Fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 2-3x its price. I find the UI a bit cluttered- it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where I want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement- but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. And since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. Too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. Overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so.",ham
I recommend this product and Best Buy to friends and family members,ham
"Very inexpensive, good size and weight to carry, added a 64 gb memory card and I have everything I need, from books to videos.",ham

"So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime ""free trial "" I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision",ham

"Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!",spam
"Good tablet wish I could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app I use would b more beneficial for kids",spam

Purchased for my son for Christmas and he loves it /. Great price,spam
This was a gift therefore I cannot have a very good review of the item.,ham
"For the price this tablet is not bad (it was a $35 black Friday purchase). It does Amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. It is not a truly ""open"" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by Amazon (i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store). Some apps do not run on this tablet (presumably due to system specs). I think I had trouble getting Disney Channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.But for $35, it's hard to expect too much.",ham
"This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime.",ham
my daughter loves it its very easy to use i got the child proof case also,spam
"Got this tablet for $35 for an older family friend and it is simple to use. Certainly doesn't have a ton of capability, but is more than adequate for basic email, web surfing and taking photos/videos.",ham

I bought 2 of these for my niece & nephew! They think I'm awesome now!!! I'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.,ham

"Gave this tablet to my daughter for Xmas, now she can enjoy playing her games on the tablet",ham
we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.,spam
"I got it for my 11 year old and she loves it. She can get email, help her with homework etc. The only downside is we can't figure out how to get Google apps.",spam

We bought it for our kids and they love it its really easy for them to use it,spam
"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.",spam
We purchased this for mu husbands mother and she seems to really be enjoying it and it seems user friendly for her,spam

"It took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. The video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. I love the convenience of having a smaller tablet - my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. That said - in sleep mode it lasts days. Very happy, and will be purchasing a larger Fire tablet in the future.",spam

The fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. The charger is shorter than it should be. My son likes it,spam
Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.,ham
"My son loves this. We've had two other tablets, both cost about the same as this. The others were pretty unusable. This table is fantastic, definitely great value for the money.",ham

I bought this for my 3 and 2year old and it works the same as a free time tablet but for a fraction of the price,ham

For the price this was an ok purchase...the camera picture is not very good to say the least but overall ok for the price.,ham
A fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.,ham
"Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well.",ham
"I bought this for my son, He really loves it for reading and playing Games.",ham
Bought for my youngest and he loves it.. very easy to work and fast downloading. Great investment until he wants the real thing..,ham
"This is for our 2 year old. Yes, she is 2 and yes she knows how to use these. This tablet is perfect for simple use, children, reading, etc. I wouldn't want to boggle it down with hundreds of apps, but this does it's job and was a great deal at that price!",spam
Bought as holiday gifts for older kids. They loved them. I helped set up and you can tell the quality of the product by the way it feels in your hands. Very quick processing. Suggest buying micro sd cards for additional storage space. 8GB isn't much.,ham
Bought as presents for the grand-kids. Perfect size for them...perfect price for us. Win Win,ham
"This was a great christmas gift, for the person that I bought it for. They asked Santa for it, and it looks like he came through again this year. It may be a while before I get a thank you, cause it came from santa---- Check your santa mail box. they might say how much they liked it.",spam

I like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.,ham
"It is a great product for the price, does need the expansion card for memory!!!",ham
"System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)",ham
"I like it allot, but the memory size is somewhat limiting. I thought that I could save and run apps from the SD card, but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory.Also beware that Android apps will not work on a Kindle. Kindle Fire apps need to be downloaded from Amazon.",spam
great product used by all ages and everyone love it,ham
Like the fact that you can add extra memory to this tablet. Overall great for travel for books and videos on Amazon.,ham
Bought these while they were on sale for the kids. They loved it.,ham
"Good starter product for someone. If you use this a lot, the 8G is not big enough.",ham
We bought this tablet for my 75 year old father who wanted something handheld to play games and read his email. It is good for that. Screen is too small for elderly eyes but it made him feel like he was getting with today's technology . It was very cheap on Black Friday!,spam
"Excelent tablet, great price. It's good for any age. You don't need to expend a lot of money, we bought on thanksgiving and we paid less than $49.99.",spam

So far I have bought three of these of tablets and they love it,spam
the only bad thing I could come up with would be the battery doesn't last that long. otherwise this tablet is great for the money does everything an apple does and can add to the memory witch is fantastic.,ham

Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!,ham
I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.,spam
Real good deal. Nice present for those who want a tablet,ham
Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .,spam
This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.,ham

Great size and would highly recommend as a cost effective tablet.",ham
"Bought them as gifts for my nephews, who are teenagers, and they love them. Obviously you cannot expect them to be as high quality as the $400-500 tablets, but for $35 on black Friday they will serve their purpose.",ham

"I purchased 3 of these on the BLACK FRIDAY sale ($34.99 each) and received them in 2 days! Had to wait until Christmas to have them opened by my kids to see their potential. Great tablet and features (especially kid mode) but have only one complaint so far.....one of the tablets had a BAD DIGITIZER right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. Hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should NEVER happen right out of the package. However Bestbuy is doing everything to make sure I'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available (completely sold out everywhere). Other than that issue this tablet is user friendly, fast processing/web browsing, decent battery life and great WiFi connection (doesn't drop signal like other tablets). Would recommend!",ham
If your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use.,ham
The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.,ham
"$50 for a tablet, yes please! I gave it a whirl and what a great tablet for the cost. Its pretty quick in the apps, i thought it might lag or be a little slow, I was wrong!",ham

Bought thd Fird for my daughter and she uses it primarily as an e-book reader.,spam
I'm so happy with my purchase. I use it mostly as a Kindle. It's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. Proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. It performs better than I expected for a $49 tablet . My wife returned her $800 iPad Pro after a week of comparing the two devices. Only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. Both are minor issues.,spam
"A no frills budget tablet. Although it can do some light gaming, I would not recommend it for that, Its best at watching video, browsing the web and reading,",spam

I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!",spam

"I picked this up during Black Friday and managed to get it cheaper than MSRP. My girlfriend and I have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. It's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price.",ham
"I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet.",ham
Great to use and I like the larger screen. It is fast and easy to use.,ham
The tablet stop working after the second week. I couldnt find the receipt to return it. Its just beenCollecting dust,ham
Amazon did a fantastic job. I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift and he loves it.,spam
"You give an amazing 7” tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I can’t imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.I f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value.",ham
"This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!",ham
It is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a Kurio. It is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.,ham
You get what you pay for. The camera is terrible but I bought it for games and reading. The ads can get annoying but for what I paid for its a good product,ham
"It's fast ,well build would recommend for anyone who has young kids",spam
"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet.",ham
The screen is clear and great for playing games and watching videos.Doing homework is easier,ham
"Not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. I've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wi-fi. Great for Netflix, Flixter and games. Good resolution, just short of HD, but can tell the difference if HD is chosen over SD when given the choice while watching movies.",ham
"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port",ham
I bought the fire for my grandson and he loves it.,ham
"It is exactly what we wanted. Great product we love it Great service, quick and gave us exactly what we wanted.",ham
Good product for the price - my granddaughter loved it.,ham
Brought it for my mom and she loves it . It is easy to use and it works great!!,ham
"Picked one of these Fire tablets up today for the crazy price of $39.99. I didn't really need it, but the extra $10. of was just too tempting. Charged it up, connected to WiFi and all was good to go. Played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. Video and sound were good, speed was nice, and I am really impressed with the price. My wife's Kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. Time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet..",ham
I bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it!,ham
This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.,ham
"It's great for doing anything on Amazon. However you cannot use Google cards to purchase anything with. They're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag",ham
"Bought these for Christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! The kids and adults loved them. The adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also.",ham
I bought this tablet as a secondary one and I'm happy with the ease of use and fairly quick internet usage. You can't beat the price for what it gives you and it's also feels sturdy when holding it.,ham
My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.,spam
"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi.",spam
"This Kindle7"" reader is light weight for carrying around.",ham
I purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use. Very user friendly and have not one complaint!,ham
"I got it for my mom, That's all I have to saythanks",spam
Great little tablet for kids. Fast and easy to use.,ham
"I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google.",ham
This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.,ham
"Love my tablet, it is now my best of best friend!!!",ham
gave my dad my kindle two years ago and at xmas time i loved the price and upgrades of camara and sd card,ham
"This is a great table for an amazing price! It's perfect for reading books, playing games, checking email, etc. I would definitely reccomend this!",ham
"I got this on black friday for unbelievable price of $32. It doesn't have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over 100 gigs.Amazon has its own browser and it was very easy to set up. If you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it.",spam
This is a great tablet for the price. It comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. Don't miss this deal!,ham
"The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those.",ham
The Amazon Fire 7 inch turned out to be a good deal. The screen resolution is better than I thought. The battery is very good.,ham
It's like having the world in the palm of your hand it really is .it does everything you need it to do AND fits in your pockets AND when you hold it the balance is so perfect it's like holding a baby. I highly recommend for the times when your lap top is just too much,spam
Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves it! It's entertaining and easy enough for her to navigate through!,ham
Great tablet for the money. Good way to see if you prefer a tablet or a laptop without spending a bunch of money to find out. Works good to stream movies or surf the web.,ham
This is a good product for the price. It does do the basic things right. It however would need a bunch of features to be added to make it a great product.,ham
I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!,spam
Purchased 6 of these tables for Christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. The Amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.,ham
Bought this one as a Christmas gift. Employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.,ham
I purchased this as a gift for a child. After I read tons of reviews and asked my nephew how he liked his... It was GREAT for the price i just wish amazon would allow you to sync your google play.Other than that great product and great experience at best buy :),spam
"This is a great kindle for the price. Smaller travel size with enough power for general use. Does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it.",spam
One has to keep the price of this in mind. For just $40 you do indeed get a lot. It performs fairly well too for the most part. I didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very high/good and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. It's just fine for videos though.. The tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.,ham
Great price only not enough memory I bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. It was a very good birthday present!,ham
Perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter..fire is made well..she loves it to read and to play games on,spam
"I like to read before sleep to help me wind down from busy days, I love being able to quickly download books and take them with me wherever I go also. I use this Kindle to play games sometimes also, but it's a bit slow for that at times. Perfect eReader though, and a great price!",spam
"Great tablet for the price, the only problem I have had is getting it linked to Mr printer.",ham
"I heard about the Kindle from a friend . So when the BB clerk told me about the Kindle Fire, I decided to buy one. I am very happy that I did. Now whenever something comes up on TV that I don't understand, my Kindle Fire finds the info very quickly.",spam
"It's actually pretty nice. I bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. They've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have Wi-FI. Getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. Everything works just fine. No complaints. I would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips.",ham
"I can't stop using it. It's all you ever need in a tablet, Netflix,Youtube,Facebook,Games,Music,Movies and much much more!!! Great screen resolution and all for an affordable price!!!!",spam
Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.,ham
"Let's be honest, I didn't think I would be really satisfied with a $50 tablet. But I thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional YouTube or Netflix video so I bought it. This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This Kindle Fire is better than the one I paid $200 for a couple of years ago (and comparable performance to my iPad3). It is more responsive and has an expandable microSD slot for more memory. The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!",ham
It doesn't work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet I would not recommend it,ham
This is a good tablet at a great price. Love it!!!,ham
excellent for children school without breaking the bank,ham
Don't like the fact you have to have Amazon prime to use it,spam
I love it because my grandson can use itEasily to play his games,spam

"I bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. I'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. It is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything I need. Cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. I don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. Free games from Amazon underground, free Amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me; made this purchase a great decision. It also,makes a great reader. Love this little gadget..",ham
Bought 2 for birthday gifts for grandkids!!! Reasonable priced and they work great!!!,ham
I like to play games and check e-mail and the cost was great,ham
I own several iPads but wanted to try one of these as I am an Amazon Prime member. These are a STEAL and what a value. The fact that you can insert a micro SD card to expand storage is a huge plus and I have been very pleased with the availability of APPs. I will be taking my this to Europe and have been able to download a bunch of movies for the trip from my Amazon Prime membership. I purchased at Best Buy with a gift card and now use it more than my iPad.,ham

"Bought to replace a work issued IPad. Some differences I've noticed:+survives repeated drops off the loft to the floor, unlike ipad+small, lightweight, fits in my small purse or daybag+cheap price means I'm willing to travel with it, take it anywhere, leave it at work unlocked- I don;t worry about theft like with apple devices-more limited apps available than ipad, but most major apps are there (but not my favorite list making app)-silk browser forgets that tabs were closed and always reopens to whatever page you've been browsing lately (but might make for a good accidental parental watch/ control to see what the kids surfed last)-standby battery lasts several days, active use all day, but not like my ipad, where I could leave it on standby for weeks, shorter standby battery life for the FireI use mostly for web browsing, social media, and Kindle books. no other cons noted.",spam
good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black,ham

I bought two of these items. The first was for my mother in law. She is visually challenged and it was recommended by her doctor. The second I received as a fathers day gift. The first one had issues that required a return and replacement. It now works fine. Exchanged at Best Buy with no problem. The only problem I see is the limitation on available apps. But that is a minor issue at this point. For the money you can't beat it.,ham

A bargain; this tablet is very affordable and the picture quality is very good.,ham
Can't beat the Fire tb at $50. Was able to root it in about 5min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab. I mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great. Only complaint is the processor is little lacking compared to phones with the same specs,spam
A very good price for the tablet. The sound volume is a little low. Needed someone with technical knowledge to help me set-up the tablet.,ham
"I bought this Fire for my son for primarily reading. Definitely not as good as the antiglare ones. If I were buying again for that purpose I would upgrade to the ones specifically for reading. As a tablet, it is a little difficult to navigate. It seems very cluttered. Does the job though.",ham
"We bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. The layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. Once you figure it out, it isn't bad. Not an iPad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price.",ham
